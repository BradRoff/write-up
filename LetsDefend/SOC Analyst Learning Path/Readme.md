<h1>Why did I chose <a href = "This Path">?</a></h1>
As I delved deeper into the world of cybersecurity, I decided to look further into the roles of a SOC analyst. I want to be able to protect and help people, and I am very interested in the evolving ways that attackers may try to infiltrate our systems. I am also very interested in protecting against social engineering attacks, such as phishing emails. With this course, I hope to gain further hands-on knowledge and experience in the SOC analyst field.
