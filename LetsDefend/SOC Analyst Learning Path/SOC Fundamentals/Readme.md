<h1>Review for <a hreff ="https://app.letsdefend.io/training/lessons/soc-fundamentals"></a>SOC Fundamentals</h1>
<p>As expected, I knew most of the information from this first part already from my previous education. The main new 
  information was learning the four types of SOCs (In-house, Virtual, Co-Managed, and Command) and seeing the specific 
  roles that a member of a threat team may fulfill. While I do know what a security event and information management 
  (SIEM) tool is, it was very interesting to work with LetsDefend's provided tools. Their lab allowed me to interact with 
  SIEM, Log EDR, and SOAR tools. While this section was mostly explanations with examples, I am looking forward to more in-depth 
  projects in the following lessons.
