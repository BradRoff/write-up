<details><summary>creating the file Iâ€™m going to encrypt</summary>
I begin by using the following command:
	
```bash echo "This is a sample file for AES encryption lab." > test_file.txt ```

	```bash echo``` outputs a string of text.
	```bash > ``` Redirects the new string of text to the file named test_file.txt
