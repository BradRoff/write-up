<h1>Why did I chose to complete the <a hreff= "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/security-analyst-fundamentals#courses">IBM Security Analyst Fundamentals Specialization?</a></h1>

<p>After graduating from Farmingdale and starting to search for work, I wanted to refresh my knowledge of cybersecurity. 
  This course will not only be a good refresher, but it may also help me learn more about the vast cybersecurity field. 
  I will post short reviews on each chapter of this certificate in my journey to complete it.

<p>Each directory holds tghe write ups for labs and assignments I completed in each section:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting, and Cryptography</li>
  <li>Incident Response and Digital Forensics</li>
  <li>Cybersecurity Case Studies and Capstone Project</li>
</ol>
