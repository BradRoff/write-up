<h1>Why did I chose to complete the <a hreff= "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/security-analyst-fundamentals#courses">IBM Security Analyst Fundamentals Specialization?</a></h1>

<p>One of my major goals is to get into a SOC analist role. To achive this I want to try compleeting a certification from a diffrent publication, and looking over IBM showed a cert with alot of interative assignments.
</p>
<p>Each directory holds tghe write ups for labs and assignments I completed in each section:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting, and Cryptography</li>
  <li>Incident Response and Digital Forensics</li>
  <li>Cybersecurity Case Studies and Capstone Project</li>
</ol>
