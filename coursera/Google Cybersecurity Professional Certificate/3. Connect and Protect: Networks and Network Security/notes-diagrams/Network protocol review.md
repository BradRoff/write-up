<h1>Network Protocol Review</h1>
<p>&emsp;Network protocols are sets of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of the data. These networking protocols are often divided into three common categories.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Communication protocols</b> govern the exchange of information in network transmission. This includes methods to recover data lost in transit. Some examples include:</li> 
    <ul>
      <li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) forms a connection between devices before allowing the transmission of data. This is done by the three-way handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK.</li>
      <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission. Less reliable but more efficient than TCP.</li>
      <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that communicates with the client and website server via port 80.</li>
      <li>Domain Name System (DNS) is used to translate the name of a website to its respective IP address.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Management Protocols</b> are used for monitoring and managing the security on the network. This includes protocols for error reporting and network efficiency optimization.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on the network.</li>
      <li>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network protocol devices use to communicate with each other.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Security Protocols</b> ensure that the data sent and received across the network is unchanging. Some examples include common encryption protocols.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</li>
      <li>Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h3 align="center">There are networking protocols that are important to understand as you will likely be interacting with them daily.</h3>

<p>&emsp;A common networking protocol used by routers is the <b>Network Address Translation</b> (NAT) protocol, which is a consequence of IPv4. As we have the possibility of running out of IPv4 addresses, this protocol allows the router to assign private IP addresses to the connected endpoints. When an endpoint makes a request to the internet, the router will convert that address into the router's real public IP assigned by the ISP or <b>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</b> and send the request. Once the response is received, it will convert it and send it back to the endpoint. Differences between the IPs:</p>

<table align="center">
  <tr><th>Private IP Address</th><th>Public IP Address</th></tr>
  <tr><td>
    <ul>
      <li>Assigned by the router</li>
      <li>Unique only within the private network</li>
      <li>No cost to use</li>
      <li>Address ranges:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255</li>
        <li>172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255</li>
        <li>192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Assigned by ISP and IANA</li>
      <li>Unique address in the global internet</li>
      <li>Costs to lease a public IP address</li>
      <li>Assignable address ranges:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1.0.0.0-9.255.255.255</li>
        <li>11.0.0.0-126.255.255.255</li>
        <li>128.0.0.0-172.15.255.255</li>
        <li>172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255</li>
        <li>192.169.0.0-233.255.255.255</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

<p>&emsp;The <b>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</b> is a network management protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. This is done using a client-server model where a DHCP server manages a pool of IP configuration information, which are dynamically allocated to DHCP-enabled clients. DHCP servers operate on UDP port 67, while DHCP clients operate on UDP port 68. This process typically involves four steps, commonly referred to as <b>DORA</b>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>D</b>iscover: Client broadcasts a request for an IP address</li>
  <li><b>O</b>ffer: Server responds with an available IP address and configuration</li>
  <li><b>R</b>equest: Client accepts the offer</li>
  <li><b>A</b>cknowledge: Server confirms the assignment</li>
</ul>

<p>&emsp;The <b>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</b> operates between Layer 2 and Layer 3 of the OSI model, primarily used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local area network (LAN). When looking at the TCP/IP model, ARP is mainly a network access layer protocol in the TCP/IP model used to translate the IP addresses found in data packets into the MAC address of the hardware device.</p>

<p>&emsp;<b>Telnet</b> is an application layer protocol used to connect to a remote system. Similar to SSH, but is often less secure and uses TCP port 23.</p>

<p>&emsp;<b>Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)</b> is a commonly used protocol to create a secure connection to a remote system. This application layer protocol provides an alternative for secure authentication and encrypted communication. SSH operates over TCP port 22 and is a replacement for less secure protocols, such as Telnet.</p>

<p>&emsp;<b>Post Office Protocol (POP)</b> is an application layer protocol used to send and receive email from a mail server. POP3 is the most commonly used form of POP. 
  <ul>
    <li>Unencrypted, plaintext authentication uses TCP/UDP port 110</li>
    <li>Encrypted emails use Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) over TCP/UDP port 995</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>&emsp;<b>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</b> is used to transmit and route email from the sender to the recipientâ€™s address. 
  <ul>
    <li>Uses port 25 for unencrypted emails</li>
    <li>Uses TCP/UDP port 587 with Transport Layer Security (TLS) for encrypted emails</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>&emsp;Ports themselves are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). There are thousands of assigned ports that are individually assigned to perform specific tasks for our daily life. The common ones discussed here were:</p>
