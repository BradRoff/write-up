| Paragraph   | Lorem Ipsum is a type of placeholder text used in the design and typesetting industry. It originated from a scrambled section of Latin text, dating back to the 1500s. The text itself comes from a work by Cicero, a Roman orator and writer.        | And more      |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
