<h1 align = "center">Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks short Review</h1>
<p>&emspThis module went into greater depth on the applications of the eight CISSP security domains, as well as different security tools and audits used to protect assets and data. In information security, sometimes referred to as InfoSec, how a company may protect its target may change depending on the type of data being stored, such as if it is personally identifiable information (PII). A common but important principle is that of least privilege. A company should only give employees access to whatever is needed to complete their tasks efficiently and nothing more.
An organization's primary goal for security is to protect its assets, or anything that has value to the company. Protection can be broken down into threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
  <ol>
    <li><b><u>Threats:</b></u> A threat is any circumstance or event that could negatively impact an asset. This could include things such as an insider threat like human error
      or unmatched privileges, or outside threats like hackers.
    </li>
      <li><b><u>Risk:</u></b> A risk is anything that can affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. A potential risk can come in many different
        forms, commonly from an equal likelihood of a threat. Some digital risks could be having outdated software or outsourcing to third-party vendors. Physical risks are
        things like traffic, unpredictable natural disasters, or accidents.
</li>
      <li><b><u>Vulnerabilities:</u></b> A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. To avoid this, organizations must regularly check their systems for
        potential vulnerabilities to patch before they are exploited. A common vulnerability seen today is Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF), which allows an attacker to
        manipulate a server-side application to steal valuable data.

</ol>
