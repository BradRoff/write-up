  In this section, we dive depper into network vulnerabilities and how to secure networks.

  Two models are commonly used as frameworks for understanding network communication: the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model and the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The TCP/IP model is more commonly used due to its simplicity and practical application in real-world networking. In contrast, the OSI model is used more for theoretical purposes and to understand networking concepts at a more granular level.

<h3 align = "center">The TCP model:</h3>
<table align= "center">
  <tr><th>Application Layer</th>           <th>HTTP | HHTPS | SSH | FTP | SMTP</th>      </tr>
  <tr><td>Transport Layer</td>   <td>TCP | UDP</td>       </tr>
  <tr><td>Internet Layer</td>        <td>Ip address: IPV4 | IPV6</td>       </tr>
  <tr><td>Network Access Layer</td>   <td>Ethernet | Wirless Lan</td></tr>

    The <b><u>Application Layer</u></b> is responsible for making network requests or responding to requests. It defines which internet services and applications the user may access. Protocols like HTTP in this layer directly define how data packets will interact with receiving devices.
  </li>
    <li>
    <b>u>Transport Layer</u></b> is responsible for sending data between two systems or networks by using protocols to control the flow of traffic. TCP and UDP are commonly used in this layer.

<ul> <li> The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data. TCP contains the port of the packet's destination within the TCP header of a TCP/IP packet. </li> <li> The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not form a connection between devices before transferring data. UDP doesn't track the information it is sending to its destination, making it potentially less secure but much faster. It is commonly used in several instances where large amounts of data must be transferred quickly and don't need to be transferred in perfect condition, such as with video streaming. </li> </ul>
