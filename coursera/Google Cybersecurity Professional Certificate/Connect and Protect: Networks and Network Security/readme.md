  Two models are commonly used as frameworks for understanding network communication: the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model and the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The TCP/IP model is more commonly used due to its simplicity and practical application in real-world networking. In contrast, the OSI model is used more for theoretical purposes and to understand networking concepts at a more granular level.
