<h1 align = "center">Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks short Review</h1>
<p>&emsp;This module went into greater depth on the applications of the eight CISSP security domains, as well as different security tools and audits used to protect assets and data. In information security, sometimes referred to as InfoSec, how a company may protect its target may change depending on the type of data being stored, such as if it is personally identifiable information (PII). A common but important principle is that of least privilege. A company should only give employees access to whatever is needed to complete their tasks efficiently and nothing more.
An organization's primary goal for security is to protect its assets, or anything that has value to the company. Protection can be broken down into threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
  <ol>
    <li><b><u>Threats:</b></u> A threat is any circumstance or event that could negatively impact an asset. This could include things such as an insider threat like human error
      or unmatched privileges, or outside threats like hackers.
    </li>
      <li><b><u>Risk:</u></b> A risk is anything that can affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. A potential risk can come in many different
        forms, commonly from an equal likelihood of a threat. Some digital risks could be having outdated software or outsourcing to third-party vendors. Physical risks are
        things like traffic, unpredictable natural disasters, or accidents.
</li>
      <li><b><u>Vulnerabilities:</u></b> A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. To avoid this, organizations must regularly check their systems for
        potential vulnerabilities to patch before they are exploited. A common vulnerability seen today is Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF), which allows an attacker to
        manipulate a server-side application to steal valuable data.
</li>
</ol>

  &emsp;As a security professional, it is important to be able to manage risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Looking towards the National Institute of Standards and Technology, we can find the widely used <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/about-rmf/authorize-step">Risk Management Framework</a> (RMF). This framework contains seven important steps to follow when handling a potential incident.
Prepare: This step refers to all activities that are necessary to manage before a breach occurs. This could include monitoring for potential risks while implementing controls to reduce risks, and performing regular risk assessments.
  <ol>
    <li><b><u>Categorize:</u></b> This step is used to develop the risk management process and tasks. Security professionals use these processes to determine how this risk may affect the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) of systems and information.
<li><b><u>Select:</u></b> In this step, you choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect the organization. This could involve using a playbook for an already identified threat or updating a playbook where needed. Information should be organized and recorded for future use about the issue.
    </li>
<li><b><u>Implement:</u></b> This step implements the provided security and privacy plans from the organization's findings in the previous step. Having plans for potential threats will make recovery much more clean and efficient.
</li>
<li><b><u>Assess:</u></b> In this step, the organization must determine if the implementation was effective and executed correctly. Is the asset working as intended? Were any new problems found? Do we need a new plan? Is this the best course of action?
</li>
<li><b><u>Authorize:</u></b> Authorize means being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. After the plan is confirmed, a senior member will approve it for implementation, accepting any potential risks involved.
</li>
<li><b><u>Monitor:</u></b> After the fix is implemented, the organization must monitor the asset while maintaining a stable security and privacy policy. For example, are there many different types of viruses that only activate after a certain amount of time?
</li>
  </ol>
