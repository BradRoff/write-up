  The goal of this short excersise is to suggest common network hardening tools to a social media orginization that has recived a data breach.

<h2 align= "center">Part 1: Network harding tools to implement.</h2>
<p>
  &emsp;The company should implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), which consists of a combination of something the user has, knows, or is.</br>
  <ul>
<li>What the user has could include something like an ID or a security key.</li>
<li>What the user knows could be a PIN or password.</li>
<li>What the user is mostly relates to biometric data that the user cannot change, such as their eyes or fingerprint.</li>
    </ul>
&emsp;Additionally, the company should increase employees' overall security awareness. This could be achieved through regular security seminars where employees are educated on common security practices and potential risks to avoid. These seminars should also include guidance on implementing stronger password policies.</br>
&emsp;The company should also implement and maintain a firewall policy to block any potentially harmful traffic from entering the network.

<h2 align= "center">Part 2: Recomendation explination</h2>
<p>&emsp;
  Enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) will greatly improve security by adding an additional layer of protection beyond just a password. This will also reduce the likelihood of both brute-force attacks and users sharing their passwords, as MFA requires an additional piece of information. It is harder for a user to share their password with a coworker if they also require a fingerprint.

&emsp;Increasing employees' overall security awareness will help defend against several attack vectors. It will be particularly effective against phishing attacks as their knowledge grows. Along with a strong password policy, this will significantly reduce the risk of brute-force attacks, as employees will use more complex, non-default passwords. Employees will also be less likely to share their passwords, knowing the potential dangers. This password policy could also enforce semi-regular password changes to prevent passwords, potentially discovered in a previous attack, from being reused.

&emsp;Having a strong firewall policy that is regularly maintained and updated is very important. This policy should be as up-to-date as possible to allow or deny traffic based on current threats. The firewall rules can also be updated as new attacks occur to prevent the same malicious attack from happening again.
