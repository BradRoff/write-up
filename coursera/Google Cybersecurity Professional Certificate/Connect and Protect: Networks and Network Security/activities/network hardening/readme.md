  &emsp;The company should implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), which consists of a combination of something the user has, knows, or is.</br>>
  <ul>
<li>What the user has could include something like an ID or a security key.</li>
<li>What the user knows could be a PIN or password.</li>
<li>What the user is mostly relates to biometric data that the user cannot change, such as their eyes or fingerprint.</li>
    </ul>
&emsp;Additionally, the company should increase employees' overall security awareness. This could be achieved through regular security seminars where employees are educated on common security practices and potential risks to avoid. These seminars should also include guidance on implementing stronger password policies.</br>
&emsp;The company should also implement and maintain a firewall policy to block any potentially harmful traffic from entering the network.
