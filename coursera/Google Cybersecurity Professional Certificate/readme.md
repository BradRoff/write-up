<h1>Why did I chose to complete the <a hreff= "https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/oogle-cybersecurity"> Google Cybersecurity 

  Professional Certificate? </a></h1>

<p>After graduating from Farmingdale and starting to search for work, I wanted to refresh my knowledge of cybersecurity. 
  This course will not only be a good refresher, but it may also help me learn more about the vast cybersecurity field. 
  I will post short reviews on each chapter of this certificate in my journey to complete it.
