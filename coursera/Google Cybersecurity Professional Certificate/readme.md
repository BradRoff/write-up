<p>After graduating from Farmingdale and starting to search for work, I wanted to refresh my knowledge of cybersecurity. 
  This course will not only be a good refresher, but it may also help me learn more about the vast cybersecurity field. 
  I will post short reviews on each chapter of this certificate in my journey to complete it.
