        <li><b>W</b>ho: An organized group of unethical hackers known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries.</li>
        <li><b>W</b>hat: A ransomware attack encrypting critical files.</li>
        <li><b>W</b>here: A small U.S. healthcare clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services.</li>
        <li><b>W</b>hen: Tuesday at approximately 9:00 a.m.</li>
        <li><b>W</b>hy: The attackers were able to infiltrate the company's network via phishing emails that installed malware when an employee clicked the attachment. 
          Once the attackers gained entry, they encrypted critical files, causing major disruptions in the clinic's business operations. The motivation was likely monetary, 
          as there was a ransom note displayed on all company computers demanding a large sum of money for decrypting the files.</li>

    <th align=  "left">
      &emsp;The company should invest in security seminars for their employees to help prevent phishing attacks in the future. If the company does not have a plan of 
      action for situations like this, they should develop one to try getting operational as quickly as possible. When considering whether to pay the ransom for decryption, 
      I would strongly advise against it. The attackers currently hold all the power. They could lie and take the money without decrypting or, worse, leave a backdoor in the
      system or corrupt the information they return. Deciding whether to pay the attackers' bribe should be considered very carefully.
