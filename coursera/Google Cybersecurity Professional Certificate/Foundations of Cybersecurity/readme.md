<h1>Short review for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/">Foundations of Cybersecurity</a>.</h1>
<p>This section contained very basic information on the field of cybersecurity. 
  Some interesting topics included the Alvi brothers, who created the Brain virus in 1986, 
  which was meant to track pirated healthcare services. Unfortunately, it infected other disks and spread 
  globally over a few months, unintentionally destroying a lot of data and hardware. The most common methods 
  of attacks today come in phishing, malware, or social engineering attacks. 
  The most important aspect in this section was the eight security domains of the CISSP.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b><u>Security and Risk Management</b></u>: This domain defines the security goals, objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, and the law. For
    example, a company will need to apply specific principles according to their location, such as following GDPR if they are located in the EU or
    following HIPAA if they work with health information.
  </li>
  <li><b><u>Asset Security</b></u>: This domain focuses on the security of both digital and physical assets. It also relates to the storage 
    maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. This could involve things such as securing data with the CIA triad and properly disposing of 
    old equipment.</li>
  <li><b><u>Security Architecture and Engineering</b></u>: This domain focuses on optimizing security by ensuring the most effective tools, services, and processes are in place. This can be done by configuring or updating a firewall or designing more secure network infrastructures.</li>
  <li><b><u>Communication and Network Security</b></u>: This domain focuses on managing and securing both physical and wireless communications. This could be implemented in various ways, such as implementing a wireless policy to prevent employees from connecting to unknown networks. Another way is to monitor your endpoint traffic for anything potentially malicious or unexpected.</li>
  <li><b><u>Identity and Access Management</b></u> (IAM): This domain focuses on keeping data secure by ensuring that users follow established policies to control who controls and manages physical assets like office spaces and logical assets like networks or applications. This can come in the form of employee key card access, or multi-factor authentication.</li>
  <li><b><u>Security Assessment and Testing</b></u>: This domain focuses on conducting regular security-focused testing, collecting/analysing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. For example, security analysts may conduct regular audits on employees' permissions to make sure that users have the correct level of access. Access to classified documents should only be viewable to certain employees.</li>
  <li><b><u>Security Operations</b></u>: This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventive measures. If an incident that has happened before occurs at your company, you will likely have a log to follow to efficiently solve the incident. Any incident you solve should also be logged to help defenders in the future.</li>
  <li><b><u>Software Development Security</b></u>: This domain focuses on using a set of recommended guidelines when developing secure applications or services. For example, a software developer may ask a security analyst for advice on password policies. The code should also be regularly tested for any potential vulnerabilities.</li>
