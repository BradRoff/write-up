<h1>Short review for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/">Foundations of Cybersecurity</a>.</h1>
<p>This section contained very basic information on the field of cybersecurity. 
  Some interesting topics included the Alvi brothers, who created the Brain virus in 1986, 
  which was meant to track pirated healthcare services. Unfortunately, it infected other disks and spread 
  globally over a few months, unintentionally destroying a lot of data and hardware. The most common methods 
  of attacks today come in phishing, malware, or social engineering attacks. 
  The most important aspect in this section was the eight security domains of the CISSP.
