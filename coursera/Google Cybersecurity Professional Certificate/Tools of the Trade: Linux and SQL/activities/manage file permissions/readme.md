<h1>Use Linux commands to manage file permissions</h1>
<h3>Project description</h3>
&emp;For this senario, the reaserch team at my orginization neeeds updated file permision for the reaserch team for certian files and directories within the projects directory. The current permissions do not reflect the required authrizations. Checking and updating these permisions will increase overal security of the system.

<h3>Checking File and directory details</h3>

&emp;The screen shot above is the command I entered and its result. The command "ls -la" shows detailed infromation on each file and directory in the current directory even if it is hidden. Currently we are looking at a detailed list of the projects directoy which includes all hidden files and their respective permisions. Their are six projects one being hidden indicated by starting '.' being '.project_x.txt'. The first ten character string is what we will be changing as that is what determins the permissions for each file. The ten character string can be broken into four sections:
<table>
 <tr>
    <th>Charater</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>
